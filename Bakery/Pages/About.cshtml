                    The Bakery Shop was established in 2020, offering a wide selection of freshly baked goods and coffee that can be conveniently ordered online and delivered straight to your doorstep. The business was founded by Mike, a former farmer who discovered his talent for baking during his spare time.

                    Despite his success in the agriculture industry, Mike had always enjoyed experimenting in the kitchen and had a particular passion for baking. He spent countless hours perfecting his recipes, and soon found that his baked goods were in high demand amongst his friends and family.

                    Encouraged by their feedback, Mike decided to take a leap of faith and pursue his passion for baking full-time. He started The Bakery Shop, combining his expertise in growing top-quality food with his culinary skills to create a business that offers top-quality baked goods, made with all-natural ingredients and sourced locally.
